## INTRODUCTION

Huffman encoding is a method used for lossless data compression, primarily in the field of information theory and data compression. It was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a student at MIT in 1952. In Huffman encoding, each character or symbol in the input data is assigned a variable-length binary code, with shorter codes assigned to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes assigned to less frequently occurring characters. This way, the most common characters are represented by shorter bit sequences, leading to overall compression of the data. The process of generating a Huffman code involves constructing a binary tree called a Huffman tree. This tree is built using a frequency-based algorithm, where characters with higher frequencies are placed closer to the root of the tree, and characters with lower frequencies are placed farther away. Traversing the tree from the root to each character generates the binary code for that character. Huffman encoding is used in various applications where data compression is necessary, such as in file compression algorithms like ZIP, as well as in network protocols, image compression, and more. It is particularly effective when there are distinct differences in the frequencies of different symbols within the data, allowing for significant reduction in the size of the encoded data without loss of information. Huffman encoding is a widely used method for lossless data compression. It is particularly effective for compressing text or data with a skewed frequency distribution of symbols. Here's a brief overview of the Huffman Encoder and Decoder:

#### Huffman Encoder

- The Huffman encoding algorithm builds a variable-length prefix-free code tree based on the frequencies of symbols in the input data.
- It starts by creating a binary tree where each leaf node represents a symbol from the input data, and the frequency of each symbol determines the weight of the corresponding leaf node.
- Then, it repeatedly merges the two lowest frequency nodes into a new internal node until all nodes are merged into a single root node, forming a binary tree.
- The binary tree is traversed to assign binary codes to each symbol. Symbols that appear more frequently are assigned shorter codes, resulting in efficient compression.

#### Huffman Decoder

- The Huffman decoding algorithm takes the compressed binary data and the generated Huffman tree to decode it back into the original symbols.
- It starts at the root of the Huffman tree and traverses down the tree based on the bits in the compressed data.
- As it traverses the tree, it reads the bits and follows the corresponding path until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a decoded symbol.
- It then outputs the decoded symbol and restarts the process from the root of the tree for the next set of bits in the compressed data.

#### Use Cases

- Data Compression: Huffman encoding is commonly used in various compression algorithms like ZIP, gzip, and DEFLATE to reduce the size of files for storage or transmission. It is especially effective for compressing text files and other data with repeating patterns or skewed symbol frequencies.
- Text and Image Compression: Huffman encoding can be used to compress text documents, images, and other types of data where there are frequent occurrences of certain symbols or pixel values.
- Data Transmission: It can be used to compress data before transmitting it over networks, reducing bandwidth usage and speeding up data transfer.
- Embedded Systems: Huffman encoding is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for use in embedded systems and devices with limited computational resources.
